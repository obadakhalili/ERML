# ERML - Entity-Relationship Markup Language

ERML is a super easy-to-write DSL for representing conceptual data models via the Entity-Relationship modeling concepts.

You write ERML code (defined [here](https://erml.netlify.app/)) to represent your Entity-Relationship diagram, and the [ERML Parser](https://github.com/obadakhalili/ERML/tree/main/packages/parser) parses it into an AST, from there, an application can take the resulted AST and build all sorts of things with it, such as an [ERD Visualizer](https://github.com/obadakhalili/ERML/tree/main/packages/visualizer).

For more detailed info on where the project is heading, check out the project's roadmap [here](https://github.com/obadakhalili/ERML/issues/4).
